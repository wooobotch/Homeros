# Homeros - Graphical Adventure Engine

## Motivation
Yes, a lot.

## What?
Hahahahah, read the title.

## Why?
There is a lot of slop, sadly, and it became painfully difficult to get anything but slopware, even the AAA titles are tasteless.
I thought it was, maybe, the lack of engines or stacks dedicated exclusively to develope actual content.

## Next steps
Wait for there to be a release and stay tuned for updates (I'll wiki my way out explaining stuff).

Kisses, Abraham Ezequiel Chalave.
